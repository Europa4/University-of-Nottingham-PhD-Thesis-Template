\section{Removing the Imaginary Time Extension}
As shown earlier, the Schwinger-Keldysh contour typically uses an imaginary time extension to regulate its initial conditions. This method is intuitive, and highly efficient, but does not allow the contour to be used to it's full potential. By removing this extension and replacing it with a fixed set of initial conditions at $t = 0, dt$, drawn from a distribution dictated by the density matrix, it is possible to simulate a much wider range of non-equilibrium phenomena. Unfortunately, in doing this much of the inherent computational efficiency is lost, and significant alterations to the contour must be made.
